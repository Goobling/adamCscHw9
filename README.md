I made a fish object
and with and implemented polymorphism with a sound class
and inheritance with smallFish class, and Shark class

the main works by first making 2 fish objects using the Fish and shark types then
uses the .makeSound method on both of them to print out their name along with the sound
like car the angel fish said "bloop bloop"
